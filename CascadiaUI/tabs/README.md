# How to use this Teams Cascadia application

> Important: Please be advised that access tokens are stored in sessionStorage for you by default. This can make it possible for malicious code in your app (or code pasted into a console on your page) to access APIs at the same privilege level as your client application. Please ensure you only request the minimum necessary scopes from your client application, and perform any sensitive operations from server side code that your client has to authenticate with.

Microsoft Teams supports the ability to run web-based UI inside "custom tabs" that users can install either for just themselves (personal tabs) or within a team or group chat context. Please be advised that mgt-teamsfx-provider library in this app is currently in preview stage, please expect breaking changes in the future release.

## Prerequisites

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- An M365 account. If you do not have M365 account, apply one from [M365 developer program](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/dev-program)
- [Teams Toolkit Visual Studio Code Extension](https://aka.ms/teams-toolkit) version after 1.55 or [TeamsFx CLI](https://aka.ms/teamsfx-cli)

## Debug

- From Visual Studio Code: Start debugging the project by hitting the `F5` key in Visual Studio Code. 
- Alternatively use the `Run and Debug Activity Panel` in Visual Studio Code and click the `Run and Debug` green arrow button.
- From TeamsFx CLI: Start debugging the project by executing the command `teamsfx preview --local` in your project directory.

## Edit the manifest

You can find the Teams app manifest in `templates/appPackage` folder. The folder contains two manifest files:
* `manifest.local.template.json`: Manifest file for Teams app running locally.
* `manifest.remote.template.json`: Manifest file for Teams app running remotely (After deployed to Azure).

Both files contain template arguments with `{...}` statements which will be replaced at build time. You may add any extra properties or permissions you require to this file. See the [schema reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/resources/schema/manifest-schema) for more information.
