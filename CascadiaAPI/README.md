# Cascadia API

## Test Data

Test data loaded from [CascadiaWeb/assets/test-requests.json](CascadiaWeb/assets/test-requests.json)

## Auth

CascadiaWeb uses role based auth.  To setup auth enable group claims for "groups assigned to app", create app roles "Read" and "ReadWrite", and assign users and groups to the roles as desired in enterprise applications (may need to click create service principal to get app registration to show up in Enterprise Applications).
