# Disaster Response Data Sharing Accelerator - User Guide

The Disaster Response Data Sharing Accelerator was built from a US-based effort titled ‘Cascadia Disaster Response Exercise’.  Consequently, the documentation below uses codebase references under the ‘Cascadia’ title.  This document provides user guidance on installing / configuring the environment (Section I.), accessing / using the environment (Section II.), and extending the data sharing solution (Section III.).  Note that there is a separate document titled ‘Disaster Response Data Sharing Accelerator - Overview’ that should be referenced prior to utilizing the content below.  An Azure subscription is required.

## How to Install and Configure the Environment

## 1. Provisioning Infrastructure and API

* Clone the repository containing the Cascadia source code
* Create an Azure Resource Group called “Cascadia”
  * Additional details available here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/manage-resource-groups-portal
